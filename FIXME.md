- [x] All build stubs need extra steps to install go-bindata and then use it to generate assets
- [x] Fixed path creation : we will not assume we work on a *NIX filesystem anymore
- [x] `create` and `update` commands now return to current dir (CWD) after execution, or even failure
- [ ] DEBIAN : When depends is empty, that line should be removed from the control file
- [ ] ALPINE go fetches x86_64 instead of amd64 (__alpine/Makefile)
